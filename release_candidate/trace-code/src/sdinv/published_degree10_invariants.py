"""Published degree-10 candidates from equation (4.24).

Source of record
----------------
Cederwall, Hutomo, Kuzenko, Lechner, Sorokin, "Some remarks on invariants",
J. Phys. A 59 (2026) 065203, doi:10.1088/1751-8121/ae3bb8, equation (4.24),
journal PDF page 17 (printed page 15). Cross-checked against
arXiv:2509.14350v2 PDF page 25.

The paper states that "the symmetrization and/or anti-symmetrization of the
indices within the red brackets is made upon the anti-symmetrization within the
black brackets". That colour distinction does not survive PDF text extraction,
and neither does reliable up/down placement of stacked scripts.

Index placement is therefore DERIVED, not read: every contracted edge must
carry exactly one raised end, or it contracts with delta instead of eta. See
`docs/PUBLISHED_DEGREE10_INDEX_AUDIT.md` §0. Bracket *delimiters* are reliable
in the text stream; bracket *colour* is not, which is what AMB-01 and AMB-02
record.

    Black brackets only. Note the alpha ordering differs between the two inner
    N factors -- a1a2]a3 against a1a3]a2 -- which is carried by the einsum
    labels, not by any additional symmetrisation.

    INDEX PLACEMENT. Every contracted edge must have exactly ONE raised end;
    an edge joining two equally-placed slots contracts with delta instead of
    eta and is not Lorentz invariant. This function originally raised all six
    axes on BOTH inner N factors, so the three alpha edges (a1,a2,a3) joined
    two raised slots. The result was rotation invariant -- delta and eta agree
    on the spatial block -- but NOT boost invariant, and the degree-10
    projection correctly reported it as `not_in_atlas_span` on all six primes
    because a non-scalar cannot lie in the span of genuine invariants.

    The placement that fixes it turns on `mm`. `mixed` is M_{mu}{}^{nu}, so the
    matrix product `mixed @ mixed` contracts the up index of the first with the
    down index of the second, giving (MM)_{mu}{}^{kappa} -- slot 0 DOWN, slot 1
    UP, the opposite of what the original docstring asserted. Hence the outer N
    carries mu UP (axis 5 raised) and the second inner N carries kappa DOWN
    (axis 2 NOT raised).

    Which end of an alpha edge carries the metric is arbitrary: raising
    (0,1,2,3,4,5)/(0,1) instead of (0,1,2)/(0,1,3,4,5) gives bit-identical
    values, which is the check that this placement is right rather than merely
    boost invariant by accident. `test_p10_07_alpha_edge_placement_is_free`
    asserts it.

    `composite_n1050` performs on its own axes (0,1,2,3,4). They are therefore
    already complete before this function does anything, which satisfies the
    source requirement that black executes first -- the black stage is baked
    into the operand, not applied afterwards.

    The RED operation then acts on the surviving mu, nu, rho, lambda of the

    and only afterwards contracted with the two M blocks, so the ordering is
    BLACK -> RED as the paper requires and is not flattened.

    SOURCE AMBIGUITY (AMB-01). The red parenthesis opens before `mu` and closes
    after `lambda`, enclosing four slots, and the *colour* that would settle its
    reading does not survive PDF text extraction. Two readings are consistent

        red_reading="all4"  symmetrise mu, nu, rho, lambda together
        red_reading="pairs" symmetrise the pair (mu nu) against (rho lambda)

    Both are implemented and both are evaluated by the projection runner; the

# square glyphs. Colour is what distinguishes them and colour does not survive
