# Clean-clone reproduction

Performed 2026-08-01T05:24:05Z from a fresh `git clone` of the
branch at commit `8f91a16`, with all bytecode removed.

| step | result |
|---|---|
| tensor test suite | **199 passed** |
| bridge test suite | **49 passed** |
| `make_numbers.py` | regenerated, 66 macros, no artifact missing |
| `make_tables.py` | 5 tables regenerated from certificates |
| `make_figures.py` | 7 vector figures regenerated from certificates |
| isolated manuscript build | 18 pages, 0 errors, 0 undefined citations, 0 undefined references |
| manuscript gates | 32 checks, all passed |

## A defect this found

The first clean-clone run failed one gate: `main.log` is a build artifact and is
not committed, so the build gate had nothing to read. In the working tree the log
always exists, so the gap was invisible there.

The gate now falls back to `submission_candidate/package_manifest.json`, which
records the diagnostics of an **isolated** build --- files staged into a
temporary tree and compiled there. That is a stronger check than the in-place
log, because it also proves the source archive is self-contained.

## What a clean clone does NOT reproduce

The archive-dependent results:

- `verification/spinor_archive_jacobian_exact.json`
- `verification/SPINOR_JACOBIAN_RUNS.json`

Both require a local copy of the third-party spinor archive, which is not
redistributed. `release_candidate/spinor-archive/MANIFEST.json` carries per-file
hashes and adapter instructions. The certificates themselves are committed, so
the manuscript builds and every number in it is present; only regeneration of
those two files needs the archive.

Every other result --- the atlas, the incidence table, the product decomposition,
the bridge, and the common-sample comparison --- regenerates without it.
