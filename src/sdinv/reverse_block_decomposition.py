"""Independent reverse search: degree-10 scalars from quadratic-block topology.

Purpose
-------
The published equation-(4.24) candidates span Q10. This module asks the same
question from the other end, WITHOUT reference to those formulas: enumerate
compact contractions of quadratic blocks directly, evaluate them exactly, and
see whether the quotient is reached.

Independence is a hard constraint. Nothing here imports
`published_degree10_invariants`, and no published coordinate vector may be
consulted during generation. The published result is ground truth for
comparison AFTER a span has been recovered, never an input to the search.

Why the enumeration is tractable at all
---------------------------------------
A degree-10 scalar is five quadratic blocks, each degree 2 in F. Blocks are
`M` (2 slots), `N^(1050)` (6 slots) and `N^(4125)` (6 slots). A naive search
over perfect matchings of the raw index slots is hopeless: five `N` blocks give
30 slots and 29!! ~ 6.2e15 matchings.

But the slots are not distinguishable. `composite_n1050` antisymmetrises axes
(0,1,2,3,4), so those five slots are interchangeable up to sign, and only axis
5 is distinct. Each block therefore has two SLOT CLASSES:

    class A -- axes 0..4, multiplicity 5, antisymmetric
    class B -- axis 5,    multiplicity 1

A contraction is then fully described by how many edges join each ordered pair
of (block, class) endpoints. That is a small integer enumeration with degree
constraints, and it is what `enumerate_topologies` walks.

Pruning, in the order applied
-----------------------------
1. **Forbidden traces.** An edge joining two class-A slots of the SAME block
   contracts two indices inside an antisymmetric group, which vanishes
   identically. Rejected before any arithmetic.
2. **Degree feasibility.** Every block must use exactly its slot multiplicity.
3. **Young symmetry / canonicalisation.** Topologies related by relabelling
   the blocks describe the same scalar. A canonical form under the block
   permutation group removes those duplicates.
4. **Connectivity.** A disconnected topology factorises into a product of
   lower-degree invariants, which lives in the product subspace and cannot
   contribute a primitive direction.

Index placement follows the same rule the forward work established: every
contracted edge carries exactly one raised end, or it contracts with delta
instead of eta and is not a Lorentz scalar.
