# Terminal clean-clone reproduction

Fresh `git clone` of the public branch into a directory outside iCloud, with all
bytecode removed, using only the locked dependencies.

| step | result |
|---|---|
| clone at `c4d250d` | ok |
| tensor test suite | **199 passed** |
| bridge test suite | **72 passed** (55 structural + 17 adversarial), ~150 s |
| regenerate numbers from certificates | 67 macros, no artifact missing |
| regenerate tables | 5 |
| regenerate long-form figures | 7 |
| regenerate PRL figures | 2 |
| PRL build | **4 pages, 0 errors, 0 undefined citations** |
| manuscript gates | **32 checks, all passed** |

## What a clean clone does NOT reproduce

The two archive-dependent artifacts:

- `results/rank81/certificate.json`
- `results/rank81/minor81_certificate.json`

Both need a local copy of the third-party spinor archive, which is not
redistributed. `release/spinor-archive/MANIFEST.json` carries per-file hashes and
adapter instructions; `scripts/verify_archive.py` checks a reader's own copy
before use. The **certificates themselves are committed**, so every number in
both manuscripts is present and both build from a clean clone — only
*regeneration* of those two files needs the archive.

Everything else — the atlas, the incidence table, the product decomposition, the
bridge, degree-8 span equality, the stress-trace sector, all figures and tables —
regenerates without it.
