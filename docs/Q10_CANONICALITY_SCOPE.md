# Exactly what is claimed for the Q10 Level-B basis

## 1. The claim, in the only permitted wording

> **Preferred Level-B basis among the twelve published degree-10 candidates
> under the documented deterministic simplicity score, verified at one fit and
> one holdout prime.**

    { P10_10, P10_11, P10_12 }

**Not** universally canonical. **Not** the simplest structure reaching Q10.
**Not** ambiguity-free — see §3, which is the most important section here.

## 2. Why "canonical" is unavailable

Canonicality would require a proof over a search space that has not been
enumerated. Only twelve structures were tested — the ones equation (4.24)
happens to display. The space of compact `M / N^(1050) / N^(4125)` contractions
of degree 10 is very much larger, and nothing here bounds it. A simpler
representative could exist outside the published list and this work would not
have seen it.

That is what the reverse graph-to-block benchmark exists to probe.

## 3. The basis is NOT ambiguity-robust, and cannot be

This correction matters more than the selection itself, so it is stated before
the score rather than after it.

Bracket **colour** does not survive PDF text extraction, and colour is what
fixes operation order in equation (4.24). Both readings of every ambiguous
candidate were implemented and projected. Measured:

| candidate | ambiguity | quotient image under the two readings |
|---|---|---|
| P10_10 | AMB-02 | **identical** |
| P10_12 | AMB-02 | **identical** |
| P10_11 | AMB-02 | **differs** |
| P10_09 | AMB-01 | **differs** |

Now count. `P10_10` is forced — it is the only candidate reaching the third
quotient coordinate, so every independent triple contains it. The remaining two
slots must be filled from `{P10_09, P10_11, P10_12}`, and only **one** of those
three is robust.

> **Therefore no ambiguity-robust three-element basis exists within the twelve
> published candidates.** Every independent triple contains at least one member
> whose quotient image moves when the source reading is resolved.

The selected basis contains exactly one such member, `P10_11`, which is the
minimum achievable. Calling the result "the robust basis" would be wrong; it is
the *ambiguity-minimal* basis. Only `P10_10` and `P10_12` are unconditional.

**Consequence.** Resolving AMB-01 and AMB-02 from a colour render of journal
page 17 is a binding scientific prerequisite for an unconditional basis, not a
tidiness item.

## 4. The three independent triples, and why this one wins

| triple | score | non-robust members |
|---|---:|---|
| **{P10_10, P10_11, P10_12}** | **222.2** | P10_11 |
| {P10_09, P10_10, P10_12} | 233.1 | P10_09 |
| {P10_09, P10_10, P10_11} | 283.7 | P10_09, P10_11 |

`{P10_09, P10_11, P10_12}` is dependent and is not a basis.

The top two triples each carry exactly one non-robust member, so the ambiguity
penalty does not separate them; the remaining score does. `P10_09` loses to
`P10_11` because it carries a RED symmetrisation expanding to 6 permutation
terms plus an extra `M` block, against `P10_11`'s single unbracketed
five-`N^(1050)` contraction.

The third triple carries two non-robust members and is eliminated by the
penalty alone.

## 5. Score definition

Lower is simpler. Weights are stated, not tuned.

| term | weight | rationale |
|---|---:|---|
| source-ambiguity penalty | 50 | dominates; a basis element that moves when the source is resolved is not a stable answer |
| block count (M + N1050 + N4125) | 10 each | the dominant structural cost |
| BLACK bracket operations | 5 each | explicit symmetrisation work |
| RED bracket operations | 8 each | staged, and strictly harder to transcribe correctly |
| expanded permutation terms | 1 each | a RED sym over k slots expands to k! |
| measured runtime, seconds | 1 each | tie-breaker only |

**Ambiguity robustness outranks evaluation cost by construction**: the penalty
is 50, larger than any achievable difference in the remaining terms across
these candidates. That ordering is a deliberate scientific judgement — a
cheaper formula whose meaning is uncertain is worth less than a costlier one
whose meaning is fixed.

### Terms declared but not separating

`coefficient height` and `manifest symmetry` appear in the specification and
are **not** implemented as score terms. They would not change the ranking here:
all three triples are drawn from the same four candidates, every basis
coefficient is a generic residue of comparable height at both primes, and no
candidate carries a manifest symmetry the others lack. They are recorded as
absent rather than silently folded in at weight zero.

`peak RAM` is likewise not a separating term — the four candidates evaluate
within the same allocation profile, dominated by the shared `composite_n1050`
tensor rather than by anything candidate-specific.

## 6. Stability of the selection

The independent-triple set is identical at both primes, so the selection is not
an artifact of one modulus. It **is** conditional on the AMB-02 reading
recorded for `P10_11`: if that reading is resolved against the implemented one,
`P10_11`'s quotient vector changes and the triple must be re-scored. The
selection machinery is deterministic and re-runnable, so this is a rerun rather
than a re-derivation.
