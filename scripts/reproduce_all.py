"""Run the full reproduction sequence and record what actually happened.

The reproduction record was written by hand twice and went stale both times --
it claimed 199 and 49 tests when the suites were 207 and 72, and 32 gates when
there were 60. A record of a run should be produced by the run.

This script executes each step, captures the real numbers, and writes
`verification/REPRODUCTION_RECORD.json` plus a markdown table beside it. It exits
nonzero if any step fails, so it is a check and not only a report.

    python scripts/reproduce_all.py                  # full sequence
    python scripts/reproduce_all.py --skip-tests     # everything but the suites
    python scripts/reproduce_all.py --skip-build     # no LaTeX required

Archive-dependent artifacts are NOT regenerated: they need a copy of the
third-party spinor archive that is not redistributed. They are committed, so
every number in both manuscripts is present without it. The record says which
steps were skipped rather than implying a fuller run than occurred.
