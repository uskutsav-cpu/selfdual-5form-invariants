"""Closure of the pure stress flow starting from a given seed.

The flow d V/d lambda = f(T[V], lambda) is expanded as a sum over trace
generators with arbitrary lambda-dependent coefficients. Each certificate
target is one (generator, field_degree, coefficient_monomial) row giving the
resulting coordinates in the degree basis.

A target is ACTIVE once every factor of its coefficient monomial lies in the
span already reached. Adding active rows can enlarge the span, which can
activate further targets, so we iterate to a fixed point. The fixed point is
the smallest stress-closed family containing the seed.
